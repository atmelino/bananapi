For a new system install, in order to make the python script run automatically when the computer is started,

open a terminal and run

crontab -e

add the line

@reboot /media/data/public_html/bananapi/projects/powerMonitor/autoStartPM.sh  >> $HOME/testpylog.txt 2>&1

the script autoStartPM.sh is then automatically started when the system boots. 



To disable the autostart, run

crontab -e

and convert the line to a comment.

To run it at at startup again, uncomment the line.
